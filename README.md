AI Impact on Jobs by 2030
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on different job roles by the year 2030. Using a structured dataset and exploratory data analysis, the study evaluates automation risk, AI exposure, salary trends, and skill requirements across various professions.

The goal is to understand which jobs are most vulnerable to automation and which are more resilient in an AI-driven future.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset (AI_Impact_on_Jobs_2030.csv) contains information on multiple job roles with the following key attributes:

Job_Title – Name of the profession

Average_Salary – Average annual salary

Years_Experience – Required years of experience

Education_Level – Minimum education level

AI_Exposure_Index – Degree of AI interaction in the role

Tech_Growth_Factor – Growth potential of technology in the field

Automation_Probability_2030 – Likelihood of automation by 2030

Risk_Category – Automation risk (Low / Medium / High)

Skill_1 to Skill_10 – Skill importance scores

🧠 Analysis Performed

The Jupyter Notebook (AI Impact.ipynb) includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Key Insights

Jobs with high AI exposure and repetitive tasks show higher automation risk

Technical and research-oriented roles remain more resilient

Skill diversity significantly reduces automation probability

Education level alone does not guarantee job safety
